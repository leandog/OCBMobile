OCBMobile
=========
This is the official repo for the [Ohio City Burrito](http://ohiocityburrito.com/) mobile app!  

We've stripped out the images in the application to protect OCB from burrito bandits who might try to use their sweet logo for heinous evil purposes.

This is VERY much a work in progress (and in production!) and we encourage feedback to help us add useful features, help us refine our tools and processes, and build better, mo' useful software together.

Who knows, if we dig your feature and/or pull request enough, maybe we'll buy you a burrito!
